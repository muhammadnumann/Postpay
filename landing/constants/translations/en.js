  ResponsibleSpendingContent: `
    <p>
      We strive to empower you, our customers and we are committed to
      helping you spend responsibly. As our customers, you are at the
      core of our offering and in addition to not charging you interest
      or fees we also aim to ensure you use Postpay in a responsible and
      sustainable way. Since you are fully in control of how you use
      Postpay, here are some key guidelines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Do not purchase what you cannot truly afford</strong>
        <p>
          Postpay is aimed at facilitating those immediate purchases
          that you can afford. If you know you that you will not afford
          to repay the instalments then it would be advisable to only
          purchase what you can truly afford today.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It is always better to settle your account earlier</strong>
        <p>
          Our product is straightforward, buy now and pay in 3 monthly installments. You can always
          settle your account earlier at absolutely no extra cost.
          If you are able to settle your account earlier then do so to
          minimize the risk that you cannot make these repayments later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep track of your instalments to ensure Postpay is always free</strong>
        <p>
          Sign-in to your dashboard or check your emails regularly to
          ensure you are aware of when repayments are due. This way you
          ensure you have funds available on the payment method,
          alternatively, update your instalment with a new valid payment
          method to avoid late fees.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Get in touch if you need help</strong>
        <p>
          We are truly committed to making sure you have a seamless
          customer experience. If you have any questions on how Postpay
          works then please visit our FAQs or contact our dedicated

  DeclinePurchasedContent: `
    <p>Here are a few reasons as to why you may be getting denied:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Too many ongoing installment plans.</strong>
        <p>
          Postpay will inform you when you are rejected due to too many ongoing installment plans. You will have to pay off one of the existing plans first. This may be done ahead of the due date or you may wait until the system automatically deducts the amount on the due date itself.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unpaid Installments.</strong>
        <p>
          If you have any overdue installments, the system will not allow you to complete another installment plan. In order to complete another installment plan, you must have no overdue installments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>International Cards.</strong>
        <p>
          We currently do not accept International Cards for our ‘Pay in 3’ solution. However, we are working constantly to increase coverage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Insufficient Funds.</strong>
        <p>
          Please make sure the card you are using has sufficient funds or in the case that it is a credit card, that the limit spent has not been exceeded.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frozen Customers.</strong>
        <p>
          Trying to complete the purchase several times after getting denied may result in your account being suspended. Please try again within 30 days.
