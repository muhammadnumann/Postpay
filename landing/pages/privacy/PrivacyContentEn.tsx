    {/* This is the best place to jump and display the "how we use coookies" */}
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for
      their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine
      your personal information with information we collect from other companies
      and use it to improve and personalize postpay Services, content, and

    </p>

    <h3>How we use cookies and similar technologies</h3>
    <p>
      When you access our website or use postpay Services, we (including
      companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or
      other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, e-tags, “Flash
      cookies,” or other local storage provided by your browser or associated
      applications (collectively “Cookies”). We use these technologies to
      recognize you as a customer; customize postpay Services, content, and
      advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your
      account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and
      to promote trust and safety across our sites and postpay Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on
      permits, unless our Cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the
      security of websites we control. However, declining our Cookies may
      interfere with your use of our website and postpay Services.
    </p>

    <h3>How we protect and store personal information</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to
      describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can
      be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information
      to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not
      identify a specific user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based
      servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including,
      but not limited to, the use of third-party service providers. We, and
      third-party service providers on our behalf, store and process your
      personal information in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere in the
      world. If your information is transferred to other countries, including
      countries which may not have data protection laws that provide the same
      level of protection that exists in your country, we will protect the
      information as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative
      security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized
      access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are
      firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to data centers,
      and information access authorization controls.{" "}
    </p>

    <h3>How we share personal information with merchants</h3>
    <p>
      When transacting with Merchants, we may provide those parties with
      information about you necessary to complete the transaction, such as your
      name, account ID, contact details, shipping and billing address, or other
      information needed to promote the reliability and security of the
      transaction. If a transaction is held, fails, or is later invalidated, we
      may also provide details of the unsuccessful transaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not share your bank account information or card account information
      with any Merchants. We work with third parties, including merchants, to
      enable them to accept or send payments from or to you using postpay. In
      doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as
      your email address or mobile phone number. We use this information to
      confirm that you are a postpay customer and that postpay as a form of
      payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of payment status.
      Also, if you request that we validate your status as a postpay customer
      with a third party, we will do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract
      with have their own privacy policies, and although postpay’s user
      agreement does not allow the other transacting party to use this
      information for anything other than providing postpay’s Services, postpay
      is not responsible for their actions, including their information
      protection practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account
      number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using postpay, or with
      the third parties that offer or use postpay Services, except with your
      express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit
      card rules or other legal process.
    </p>

    <h2>How we share personal information with other third parties</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your personal information we collect from you, including your
      name, contact details, and transactions and activities, with:

        Members of the postpay corporate family, to help detect and prevent
        potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide
        decisions about their products, services, and communications. Members of
        our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing
        communications only if you have requested their services. Financial
        institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product.
        These financial institutions may only use this information to market
        postpay-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as
        permitted by law.
      </li>

        Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for
        inclusion on their list of terminated merchants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Companies that we plan to merge with or are acquired by. (Should such a
        combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow
        this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your
        personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will
        receive prior notice.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant
        to a court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to
        postpay or one of its affiliates; when we need to do so to comply with
        law or credit card rules; or when we believe, in our sole discretion,
        that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent
        physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or
        to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other unaffiliated third parties, for the following purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>

            Customer Service: for customer service purposes, including to help
            service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or
            transactional).
          </li>
          <li>
            Legal Compliance: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and
            counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service Providers: to enable service providers under contract with
            us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention,
            bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology
            services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only
            use your information in connection with the services they perform
            for us and not for their own benefit.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the
      laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you open a postpay account directly on a third party website or via a
      third party application, any information that you enter on that website or
      application (and not directly on a postpay website) will be shared with
      the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are
      governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review
      their privacy policies before providing them with personal information.
      postpay is not responsible for the content or information practices of
      such third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>How you can access or change your personal information</h2>
    <p>
      You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging
      in to your account and reviewing your account settings and profile. You
      can also close your account through the postpay website. If you close your
      postpay account, we will mark your account in our database as “Closed,”
      but may retain personal information from your account for a certain period
      of time and disclose it in a manner consistent with our practices under
      this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed. We also may retain
      personal information from your account to collect any fees owed, resolve
      disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, prevent
      fraud, enforce our User Agreement, or take other actions as required or
      permitted by law.
    </p>
